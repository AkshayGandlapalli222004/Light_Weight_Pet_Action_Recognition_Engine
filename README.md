# Light_Weight_Pet_Action_Recognition_Engine
A collection of tools for the discrete classification of animal behaviors using low-dimensional representations of videos (such as skeletons provided by tracking algorithms). Our approach combines strong supervision, weak supervision, and self-supervision to improve model performance.
